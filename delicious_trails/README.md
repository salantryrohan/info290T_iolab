###Project description
Trailmaster is an implementation of #2 in the project suggestions. It allows you to browse a Delicious user's trails. There are 3 basic steps:  
1) Enter a Delicious username, and click Get Trails. This will bring up a list of trails from the account.  
2) Click one of the trails to view it.  
3) Trailmaster will display the first step in the trail. From there, you can step forward (and backward) to view other links in the trail. Trailmaster will show the bookmark title, URL, any extra notes, tags, and an iframe of the URL.  
  
At any point, you can click on a different trail, or enter a new username to pull.

###Any bugs/quirks we should be aware of
We're using iframes to show a preview of the link, which can cause some issues. For example, in our social media trail, pretty much all of the sites block iframes, so the preview doesn't show up. Other than that, the iframes also seem to make it run a little slow.  

We haven't been working with bookmarks that have multiple trail/step tags on them - it probably won't behave correctly if those are pulled.
